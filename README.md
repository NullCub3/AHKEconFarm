# AHK Econ Farm
 
Hello fellow Comrads and Capitalists, I am here to present to you an updated version of a exciting opportunity. A fully automated script that will work the economy bot, now even while you're using your computer. The process is simple, provided you have a Windows PC.

As for the script itself, every time it goes through the work cycle, it will cost 42 units of our currency, a flat fee. This can work to your benefit, as if you earn larger amounts you don't have to pay as much as compared to if it was going by a percent system.

## Version 2.0

Before, EconFarm was great for AFKing overnight, but unless you had a separate device to run it on, it wasn't really usuable during the day. That's what version 2.0 hopes to improve. When the script is running, every ten minutes it will switch to Discord and type in the economy commands. And once it's done, it will minimize Discord and you will be right back where you left off! **NOTE: If you run it with administrator, the script will be able to temporarily stop you from interacting with your computer while it's entering the commands, so you won't accidentally mess it up. This is not required for the script to work, but it is more reliable when done this way.**

## Instructions:
There are two methods for running AHKEconFarm. The first is the easiest, but you do have to run a exe file that I made. So depending on how much you trust me, this may or may not be an option for you. Don't ever run exe files from people you don't trust.

The second method is by downloading AutoHotKey and running the source code through that. This is the safer option as you can look at the code and know that there isn't anything fishy.

### EXE Method:
 1. Download the EXE on the [latest release](https://github.com/NullCub3/AHKEconFarm/releases/latest)
 2. Locate the download
 3. Give Discord a separate **window** (not tab) and open it up to the economy channel (I recommend using a separate browser window)
 4. Run the "AHKEconFarm_v1.x.exe" file
 5. A pop-up will appear with keybind information, click OK to start the script
 6. Wait 10 minutes and the script will switch to Discord and do its thing!
 7. ???
 8. Profit!!!

 1. Download and Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
 2. Download the source code of the [latest release](https://github.com/NullCub3/AHKEconFarm/releases/latest)

 4. Give Discord a separate **window** (not tab) and open it up to the economy channel (I recommend using a separate browser window)
 5. Run the "AHKEconFarm_v2.x.exe" file
 6. A pop-up will appear with keybind information, click OK to start the script
